## Usage

Using the Laptop Cost Evaluator is straightforward:

1. **Enter Specifications**: Fill in the details of the laptop, including:
   - Brand
   - Processor
   - RAM
   - Storage

2. **Submit the Form**: Click the "Evaluate" button to get an instant price estimate.

3. **View Results**: The estimated market price will display below the form.

## How It Works

The Laptop Cost Evaluator uses a machine learning model trained on historical laptop pricing data. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Data Collection**: The model collects data from various sources, including online marketplaces and retailer websites.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data is cleaned and formatted using Pandas. This includes handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.

3. **Model Training**: The cleaned data is used to train a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow. The model learns the relationships between laptop specifications and their market prices.

4. **Prediction**: When a user inputs specifications, the model processes the input and predicts the market price based on learned patterns.

5. **Display Results**: The estimated price is sent back to the user interface and displayed for the user to see.
